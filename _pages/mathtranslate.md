This is a project to provide translation of scientific papers with heavy math symbols from any language to any language while keeping the math symbols unchanged. In most translation softwares you wouldn't be able to keep equations and it would annoy you. It has more than 700 stars on [github](https://github.com/SUSYUSTC/MathTranslate).

Here's an example of what you get finally by this tool.

Although it is currently a small project, we are aware that this project has received much more attention that we expected. We are planning more developments for better user experience.
