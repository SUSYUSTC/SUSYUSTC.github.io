This is a project to translate LaTeX documents, especially scientific papers, from any language to any language. LaTeX expressions like math expressions are perfectly kept unchanged. LaTeX documents can finally be compiled into PDF files. Especially it can be directly applied to translate arXiv papers since it provides the LaTeX source code of most of the papers. It has nearly 1000 stars on [github](https://github.com/SUSYUSTC/MathTranslate). We also provide a [website](http://mathtranslate.xyz) for free and unlimited translation of arXiv papers 

Here's an example of what you get finally by this tool.
