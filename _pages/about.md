Hello! I'm currently navigating my fifth year as a Ph.D. student at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), within the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. My journey in science began with earning a Bachelor of Science in Theoretical Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My primary research interests lie in the vast and vibrant field of quantum sciences, such as quantum computing, electronic structure, and quantum dynamics. While my fascination with these areas drives my academic endeavors, I am also keen on exploring how they can be enhanced by integrating principles of machine learning. My goal is to develop quantum and classical algorithms that are not only elegant in theory but also superior in computational efficiency.

Outside the lab, my interests include championing Linux for its innovation in technology and enjoying traditional Chinese music, which connects me to my cultural roots.

As I approach the completion of my Ph.D., I am actively seeking postdoctoral positions that will allow me to further explore and expand upon my research interests in quantum science. I am eager to contribute to and collaborate with teams that are at the forefront of this exciting field.

For more information about my academic and research background, please feel free to view my [CV](/files/CV_JiaceSun.pdf).

Finally I want to express my gratitude to ChatGPT for helping craft this text. ChatGPT is a very friendly tool, especially for non-native English speakers.
