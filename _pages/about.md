Hello! I’m currently a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech in Garnet Chan’s group. I also completed my PhD at Caltech, where I was co-advised by Tom Miller and Austin Minnich. Before that, I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My primary research interests lie in the vast and vibrant field of quantum sciences, such as quantum computing, electronic structure, and quantum dynamics. While my fascination with these areas drives my academic endeavors, I am also keen on exploring how they can be enhanced by integrating principles of machine learning. My goal is to develop quantum and classical algorithms that are not only elegant in theory but also superior in computational efficiency.

Outside the lab, my interests include championing Linux for its innovation in technology and enjoying traditional Chinese music, which connects me to my cultural roots.

For more information about my academic and research background, please feel free to view my [CV](/files/CV_JiaceSun.pdf).
